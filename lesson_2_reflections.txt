Q. What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
A. When git is initialized, The repository is being tracked.
HEAD position is also assigned. .git file helps keep track of the
different versions of the file.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. Well, Repository consists of the files with the latest commit
and their versions. While the working directory contains the latest
edit of the files or new files that are yet to be saved.
Staging area is used to bundle up multiple files to be saved simultaneously
as a single commit.
It provides better control over what we commit. Like a single change
can have effects on multiple files. So we edit all those files and
and commit them together with a single git commit message.

Q. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?
A. When you perform experimental changes or add a new feature or fix bugs.
