Q. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
   help you see the bug that was introduced?
A. How you ask.. hmm.. Well, it's simply amazing to learn what all
industries use in the first place. And diff helps to easily edit
master copy and copies of it very easily. It's an epic must know
feature.

Q. How could having easy access to the entire history of a
   file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A. This is a major advantage to projects with multiple departments
working on them. With the entire history of a file, we can easily access
stable and non stable versions of a file with no fuss.
Besides, programmers get mind fucked most often than not. Versions help
resolve the mistakes performed with unstable mind xD

Q.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google docs does?
A.Auto save leads to non logical code when it comes to programming.
Committing after logical changes that programmers comprehend will
lead to better debugging.

Q.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,
treat each file separately?
A. Because files maybe interrelated.
