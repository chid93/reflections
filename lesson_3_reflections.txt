When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    When you wish to have portability. Or when you need access to them and use
    them from multiple systems. This keeps you a git clone away from accessing
    your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For one, I'm not the only on accessing the remote repo. So there might be
    someone else who has permissions to change the same file I'm working on. So,
    if they change it without my knowledge and it gets synced to my system, I'd
    want to throw my computer out of the window for having merged unnecessary
    content to my local files!
